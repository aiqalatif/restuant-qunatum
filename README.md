A restaurant is created with admin panel support and must be verified by the admin before going live. It can toggle between open and close modes to indicate order availability. Creating food items involves uploading photos, setting names, categories, prices, subcategories, and dynamic additives. Restaurant managers can track order statuses: new, preparing, ready, picked, and self-delivered. They can view earnings, request payouts, and access stats. Additionally, restaurants can push orders to delivery boys, who receive immediate notifications for pickups
